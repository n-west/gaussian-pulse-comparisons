While working on a GMSK signal and using some GR code as a reference I noticed
that GR has two methods to design a gaussian pulse shape filter. They give
different results given the same parameters. This looks in to the matter.

I think they *might* both be valid ways to implement a gaussian pulse shape
but one of the parameters isn't what it might seem!
